#Docker image can be build using STDIN

docker build -t kumaran85:test - <<EOF
FROM alpine:latest
RUN mkdir hai
EOF

if we include "add", "copy" will fail. To make it happen

docker build -t kumaran85:test -f- . -<<EOF
FROM alpine:latest
RUN mkdir hai
COPY script.sh /usr/local/bin/
EOF

#To take from remote repo. But git should be installed on host.
docker build -t kumaran85:test -f- https://github.com/kumaran85/dockerfile.git <<EOF
FROM alpine:latest
COPY script.sh /usr/local/bin/
EOF


############

Only RUN, COPY, ADD create layers



RUN has 2 formats.
1. exec
2. SHELL 

1. When instruction executed using shell form it uses "/bin/sh -c command".
2. exec form doesn't use shell processing like RUN echo $name. It prints as $name. To print correct name from variable use shell explicitly ["sh", "-c", "echo $name"]
exec form within paranthesis and double quotes ["sh", "-c", "useradd"]

###################
CMD

CMD has 3 formats.

1. CMD ["executable" , "param1", "param2" ] #This is prefered
2. CMD ["param1" , "param2"] #as default arguments for entrypoint 
3. CMD command param1 param2 #Shell form 

There can be only one CMD instructio in Dockerfile. More than one CMD, final CMD will take impact 

When using CMD in exec form code should be enclosed in double-quotes.

While CMD in execu form, provide the full path for the excutable binary.
like 

CMD["/usr/sbin/dmidecide"]

#######################
LABEL:

Label instructions adds metadata to an image. Can be added more than one label.

#################
EXPOSE:
 Making container communication. using -P publish all exposed ports

###############

ADD:

 Add obeys following rules.

1. src must be inside the context of context.
2. if src is tar.gz, then dest will be unarchived.
3. if src is dirs, It copies entire files from dirs to dest
4. if src is URL, to coy with file name , ADD http://www.com/file /root/file
5. ADD --chown=root:staff httpd-2.4.41.tar.bz2 /roo  This instruction will extract and copy dirs httpd-2.4.41 to /root/httpd-2.4.41

When passing Dockerfile using STDIN, there's no build context , ADD contain only URL based. Docker build -t kumaran85:test - <Dockerfile.tar.gz can be any name with tar.gz 

####################

COPY:

When passging Dockerfile using STDIN, COPY can't be used. 

###############

ENTRYPOINT:

It has 2 forms.

1. ENTRYPOINT["command", "arg1", "arg2"]
2. ENTRYPOINT command arg1 arg2

if you need to write a starter script for a single executable, you can ensure that the final executable receives the Unix signals by using exec and gosu commands.
ENTRYPOINT should be allowed when container used as an executable.

#############

USER:

To execute running image as user:group
