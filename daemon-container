#Docker iptables rules are added to DOCKER chain. Don't change it.
If you need to load any rules before DOCKER chain, add rules to DOCKER-USER chain.

To use proxy in container, use ENV during build time or mentio in Dokcerfile.

Otherwise, On user home dir create as ~/.docker/config.json  and add as below

{
 "proxies":
 {
   "default":
   {
     "httpProxy": "http://127.0.0.1:3001",
     "httpsProxy": "http://127.0.0.1:3001",
     "noProxy": "*.test.example.com,.example2.com"
   }
 }
}
